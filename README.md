# Hurricanes-vs-Himmicanes
This project is a replication and response to the following article: https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8782

This article explores a hurricane data set (attached) with the following variables:
* Year: Year the hurricane took place.
* Name: Name of the hurricane.
* MasFem: The masculine/feminine index of the hurricane name. The higher this rating, the more masculine the name has been determined to be. 
* Gender_MF: 0 if male. 1 if female.
* Category: Category of the hurricane.
* alldeaths: Number of deaths from the hurricane.
* NDAM: Normalized Damage

Note: Variables starting with "Z" are standardized.

The article concluded that there are higher death counts for hurricanes with female names than male names. They determined that the reason for this difference is because people are more threatened by male names than female names and are therefore more likely to take protective measures if they hear the male name.

This paper analyzes the validity of this claim by using data visualization.
